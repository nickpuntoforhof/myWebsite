This really isn't a post intended as a persuasive essay to get people to buy generic drugs, but I'll start with a little bit on that because it's an important discussion to have.  If you are perscribed medication, and there is a generic option, ask for that generic version at the pharmacy.  If your doctor mandates that you use the brand-name version, ask them why.  

Generic drugs are not worse.  They are cheaper than the brand-name, because the brand-name enjoyed patent protection, and used that monopoly on the marked to charge more for the drug.  When the patent expires, the drug is then open to be manufactured by any company, and these drugs are usually sold at a much lower price.  Yet doctors continue to perscribe (and people continue to ask for) brand-name drugs well after generics are available.  Why? On reason is that there is an unearned stigma around generics.  American advertising likes to tell us that there is something special and unique about branded products.  There are people out there, right now, making a living off of their ability to [distinguish authentic Adidas Yeezys from fakes](https://youtu.be/X3ySrcI2mEA).  This is not the case with generic drugs.  As Patrick J. Skerrett states in a post on the Harvard Health Blog [^1]

_Generic drugs are chemical clones of their brand-name counterparts. By law, a generic drug must_
* _contain the same active ingredients as the brand-name drug_
* _be identical in strength, dosage form, and administration_
* _work the same way in the body (be bioequivalent)_
* _meet the same standards for identity, strength, purity, and quality_
* _be made by the same rules the FDA has set for the brand-name drug._


[Follow this link](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/generic-drugs-dont-ask-just-tell-201301075766) for Patrick J. Skerrett's much more informed and complete discussion of this issue.

Now that that's out of the way, what I really want to discuss here is ProPublica's various investigations into the relationsip between industry payments to doctors, and those doctors' tendency to perscribe brand-name drugs.  [^2]
